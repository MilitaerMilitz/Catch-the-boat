# Catch-the-boat
This plugin enables Battleship (aka. Catch the boat) in Minecraft.

# Install
This plugin is made for Minecraft 1.15.2. Therefore it would not work on Minecraft 1.16.5.
These Plugin needs NBT-API 2.6.0 and StructureBlockLib 2.1.0 to run. Put both with CatchTheBoat in plugins folder. Don't try to use NBT-API-2.7.1, it will not work for MC 1.15.2.
You find the needed APIs here:

NBT-API 2.6.0: https://github.com/tr7zw/Item-NBT-API/releases/tag/2.6.0
StructureblockLib: https://github.com/Shynixn/StructureBlockLib/releases/tag/2.1.0 (You need StructureBlockLib.jar)

# Using
To play use the new /battleship command. You can select between big or small Stage.
